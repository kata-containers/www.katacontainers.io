## About Kata Containers

Kata Containers is an open source community working to build a secure container runtime with lightweight virtual machines that feel and perform like containers, but provide stronger workload isolation using hardware virtualization technology as a second layer of defense. 

Since launching in December 2017, the community successfully merged the best parts of Intel Clear Containers with Hyper.sh RunV and scaled to include support for major architectures including AMD64, ARM, IBM p-series and IBM z-series in addition to x86_64. Kata Containers also supports multiple hypervisors including QEMU, NEMU and Firecracker and integrates with the containerd project among others. 

The Kata Containers community is stewarded by the OpenStack Foundation (OSF), which supports the development and adoption of open infrastructure globally. The code is hosted at GitHub under the Apache 2 license.
