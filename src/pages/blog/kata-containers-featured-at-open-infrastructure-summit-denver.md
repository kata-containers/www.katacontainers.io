Kata Containers featured at Open Infrastructure Summit Denver, April 2019

Kata Containers is going big with a significant presence planned at the upcoming [Open Infrastructure Summit](https://www.openstack.org/summit/denver-2019/) in Denver, April 29 — May 1. The Kata Containers community will join 30 other open source projects attending the Summit to collaborate in the open. If you want to be part of it too r[egister now](https://openinfrasummitandptgdenver.eventbrite.com) before prices increase on February 27.

For 2019, the Summit has expanded and rebranded from the OpenStack Summit to the Open Infrastructure Summit, reflecting the large number of open source tools used to automate modern infrastructure and the challenges of integrating them. The agenda for the event is now live and features more than 8 Kata Containers talks. Congratulations to all of the presenters!

[View the agenda for the Open Infrastructure Summit Denver](https://www.openstack.org/summit/denver-2019/summit-schedule#day=2019-04-29).

The Summit agenda is organized into 11 tracks: AI/ML/HPC; container infrastructure; CI/CD; edge computing; getting started; open development; private and hybrid cloud; public cloud; security; telecom and NFV; and hands-on workshops.

Kata sessions include:

* Kata Containers on Edge Cloud (Yuntong Jin, Yu Bai, Zhiming Hu)
* Kata Containers, story of a container runtime (Sebastien Boeuf)
* Kata Containers on Arm: Let’s talk about our progress! (Penny Zheng, Jia He)
* Tracing the life of a packet with Kata Containers (Purnendu Ghosh)
* Tailor-made security: Building a container specific hypervisor (Samuel Ortiz, Andreea Florescu)
* Kubernetes Bedtime Stories: Taking the "scary" out of production workloads (panel)
* Kata Containers Project Update (Eric Ernst, Manhoar Castelino)
* Kata Containers Project Onboarding (Xu Wang)

The Kata Containers community will also participate in collaborative sessions offered at the [Forum](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Forum), where open infrastructure operators and upstream developers will gather to jointly chart the long-term future of open source projects.

Additionally, the Kata community plans to partake in the [Project Teams Gathering](https://www.openstack.org/ptg) (PTG) event that’s co-located with the Denver Summit at the end of the week. The PTG offers dedicated meeting space for technical communities to have focused project-specific hack time together in person and also to collaborate with adjacent open source communities. The Kata team has started planning their PTG discussion topics [here](https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/katacontainers-2019-ptg-denver-agenda).

Headline sponsors for the Denver Summit are Canonical, Deutsche Telekom and Intel. [Sponsorships are available](https://www.openstack.org/summit/denver-2019/sponsors/) until April 3. [Contact](mailto:summit@openstack.org) the Summit team with any questions.
