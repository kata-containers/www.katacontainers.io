Kata Containers Architecture Committee elections for September 2019 are now… **OPEN**!!

The Architecture Committee (AC) is comprised of 5 members, who are elected by contributors. The AC elections take place every six months, in February (2 seats available) and in September (3 seats available). The AC is responsible for architectural decisions, including standardization, and making final decisions if Maintainers disagree.

**Timeline for the September election cycle:  
**• Candidacy open: September 3–12  
• "Debate period": September 13–20  
• Voting: September 23–27  
• Results: September 30

Thus, the window is open now through September 12 for candidates to post their submissions.

**The process to submit a nomination is:**

1) Review the [responsibilities](https://github.com/kata-containers/community/tree/master/elections#architecture-committee-responsibilities) of the Architecture Committee members.
