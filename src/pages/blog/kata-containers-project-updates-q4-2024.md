Welcome to our latest update on Kata Containers! We’re excited to share our progress, recent milestones, and what’s coming up next. This post covers the key achievements from the past month and gives a sneak peek into the upcoming work.

# Key Achievements
Over the past month, the Kata Containers community has
- participated in the [Project Teams Gathering (PTG)](https://openinfra.dev/ptg/) event, where contributors discussed ongoing work on improving the project’s CI/CD infrastructure, plans for the 4.0 release, and more. You can find an [overview of the sessions](https://katacontainers.io/blog/kata-community-ptg-updates-october-2024/) on the project’s blog;
- concluded the Architecture Committee (AC) election, which happens twice a year to provide a staggered process to elect new leaders while keeping continuity in the leadership. Find out more about the [new AC members](https://katacontainers.io/blog/kata-containers-ac-october-2024-election-results/) on the Kata Containers blog;
- released [3.11](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/releases) to provide a new, stable minor release for users who would like to keep up to date with the most recent developments within the project.

# What’s Coming Up
Looking ahead, the Kata Containers community:
- is planning to put out two more minor releases in 2024; and
- will conclude a university mentorship program with Boston University.

We’re currently focused on improving the CI/CD framework and test and adding features to the Rust runtime, and our team is committed to keeping the momentum going as we work toward the next, 4.0 major release of the project.
