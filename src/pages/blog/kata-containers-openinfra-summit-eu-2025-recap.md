Kata Containers and the broader OpenInfra community recently gathered at École Polytechnique in Paris‑Saclay for the much‑anticipated [OpenInfra Summit Europe](https://summit2025.openinfra.org/), on October 17–19, 2025. The event provided a great opportunity for attendees to share knowledge, maintain existing and build new connections and learn more about OpenInfra projects such as Kata.

The Kata Containers project was featured in multiple presentations throughout the event to highlight some of its strength and capabilities, and the session recordings are now available!

#Keynotes
No event keynotes pass by without talking about AI these days, and OpenInfra Summit Europe was no exception. AI has high demands for the underlying infrastructure, while it also depends on large amounts of data that are often private and sensitive. What better project could you use to train your AI models efficiently while keeping your data safe than Kata Containers?

#Breakout Sessions
Kata Containers is applicable in not just the AI and machine learning space, but also in edge computing, where devices are often in remote locations where additional measures of security is needed. During the conference, there were various sessions that explored these topic areas and highlighted how Kata Containers can be utilized to provide a secure container solution through the use of hardware virtualization.

Presentations also dove into using Kata Containers with hardware architectures such as RISC-V, or combining it with eBPF to secure workloads in a cloud environment.

#Forum Session
The Forum track at OpenInfra Summit Europe consisted of sessions where attendees were encouraged to have a conversation about the sessions’ main topics. Kata Containers contributors held a Forum session to talk about running Kata Containers in public cloud environments. Since Kata is relying on virtualization technology, in public cloud environments it usually means the need for nested virtualization which is often not supported. The Kata community has been working on solutions to this challenge, and the Forum session provided the opportunity to contributors to introduce the currently developed two options and discuss them with session attendees.
