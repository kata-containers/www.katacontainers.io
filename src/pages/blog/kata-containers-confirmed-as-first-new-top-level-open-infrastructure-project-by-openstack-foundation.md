[Confirmed status](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/Foundation/OSFProjectConfirmationGuidelines) indicates that a project has a strategic focus, well-defined governance procedures, a commitment to technical best practices and open collaboration, and an actively engaged ecosystem of developers and users.

For Kata, this is an indicator that the project is being viewed as mature and affirms that Kata is a viable solution with a sustainable community around it.

Kata Containers became a pilot project in December 2017, in conjunction with the OSF’s evolution from being the home for OpenStack to becoming the home of open infrastructure collaboration.

Kata Containers supports the OSF strategic focus area related to containers by enabling a secure runtime underneath popular container technologies like Kubernetes and Docker. This approach to running containers is deployed by hyperscale cloud providers, and Kata Containers is an open source option for any infrastructure operator to deploy their containers in a similar fashion.

## **Project Overview:**

**Kata is a universal solution, and can help with …**

*   Regulated and sensitive production environments
*   Mixed workloads production environments
