Greetings fellow Kata Herders! March has been an exciting month for Kata Containers, leading us into an even more exciting summer. In addition to a number of events coming up where Kata will have a presence, our favorite container with a kernel has been making big news — literally. Read more below to find out what’s happening.

# Release Updates

# Spring 2023 Elections

It’s that time again, everyone — elections for open chairs on the Kata Containers [Architecture Committee](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/Kata_Containers_2023_Architecture_Committee_Mtgs) are due to begin on April 5, 2023. This year’s elections will be a bit different than those before, as the amount of seats open has been expanded from two to four as a response to the monumental growth of the Kata community over the past 5 years. Any member of the community who has made a contribution to Kata Containers is eligible to run for a seat, which can be done by submitting a text file to the corresponding election folder in the kata-containers/community repo on GitHub. Further details on the candidacy process can be found on the [Spring 2023 Etherpad](https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/r.6eda58700c3dcbed6683ab567b439dde), but if you have any other questions or need help getting started, feel free to reach out on [Kata Containers Slack](http://katacontainers.slack.com/) for further guidance.

# Kata Containers in the News
