        Kata Containers is an open source community working to build a secure
        container runtime with lightweight virtual machines that feel and
        perform like containers, but provide stronger workload isolation using
        hardware virtualization technology as a second layer of defense.

        Since launching in December 2017, the community successfully merged the
        best parts of Intel Clear Containers with Hyper.sh RunV and scaled to
        include support for major architectures including AMD64, ARM, IBM
        p-series and IBM z-series in addition to x86_64. Kata Containers also
        supports multiple hypervisors including QEMU, Cloud-Hypervisor and
        Firecracker and integrates with the containerd project among others.

        The Kata Containers community is stewarded by the Open Infrastructure
        Foundation, which supports the development and adoption of open
        infrastructure globally. The code is hosted at GitHub under the Apache 2
        license.

        Runs in a dedicated kernel, providing isolation of network, I/O and
        memory and can utilize  hardware-enforced isolation with virtualization
        VT extensions.

        Supports industry standards including OCI container format, Kubernetes
        CRI interface, as  well as legacy virtualization technologies.
      title: Compatibility
    - image: /img/performance-growth.svg
      text: >
        Delivers consistent performance as standard Linux containers; increased
        isolation without the  performance tax of standard virtual machines.
      title: Performance

      text: >
        Eliminates the requirement for nesting containers inside full blown
        virtual machines;  standard interfaces make it easy to plug in and get
        started.
